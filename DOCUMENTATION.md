- **Interactive Assignments**: Create guided explorations for students to complete
- **Conceptual Reinforcement**: Help students build intuition for abstract concepts
- **Visual Learning**: Support visual learners with dynamic representations

### Lesson Plans

Here are some suggested ways to incorporate the tool into your lessons:

#### Lesson 1: Introduction to Definite Integrals (2D View)
1. Begin with simple polynomials (x, x², x³) to show area calculation
2. Explore positive and negative areas with functions that cross the x-axis
3. Demonstrate the effect of changing integration bounds
4. Compare numerical results with analytical calculations

#### Lesson 2: Exploring Function Behavior (3D View)
1. Start with basic shapes (plane, paraboloid, sphere)
2. Identify critical points and discuss their significance
3. Examine how changing coefficients affects the surface shape
4. Relate surface features to derivative concepts

#### Lesson 3: Integration Applications (Both Views)
1. Model real-world scenarios (population growth, velocity to distance)
2. Visualize probability density functions and cumulative distribution
3. Explore physics applications (work, center of mass, moments of inertia)
4. Connect 2D and 3D representations of the same concept

### Assessment Ideas

- **Exploration Tasks**: Ask students to find functions with specific properties
- **Prediction Challenges**: Have students predict the shape before visualizing
- **Comparative Analysis**: Assign students to compare different functions
- **Conceptual Questions**: Use visualizations as context for deeper questions
- **Function Modification**: Challenge students to modify functions to achieve specific visual outcomes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Blank Screen**: Check if your browser supports WebGL (use the WebGL Check page)
- **Slow Performance**: Reduce the complexity of functions or try a device with better graphics capabilities
- **Function Error**: Ensure your function syntax is correct and uses supported operations
- **Display Issues**: Try refreshing the page or switching to a different browser

### WebGL Support

The application requires WebGL for 3D rendering. If you encounter issues:

1. Visit the WebGL Check page to verify your browser's compatibility
2. Update your browser to the latest version
3. Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled in your browser settings
4. Update your graphics drivers if necessary

## Technical Requirements

- **Browser**: Modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari
- **Hardware**: Any device with WebGL support (most computers and newer mobile devices)
- **Internet**: Required only for initial loading (application runs locally after loading)
- **Screen Size**: Minimum recommended width of 768px (though responsive design supports smaller screens)
