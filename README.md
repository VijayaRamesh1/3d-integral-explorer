# 3D Integral Explorer

An interactive 3D application to help students intuitively understand integral calculus through visualization and exploration.

## Overview

3D Integral Explorer is an educational tool designed to make integral calculus intuitive and engaging. By visualizing mathematical concepts in 3D space, students can develop a deeper understanding of integrals, areas under curves, volumes of revolution, and their real-world applications.

## Features

- **Area Under Curve Explorer**: Visualize and manipulate curves to understand the fundamental concept of integration
- **Volume Revolution Lab**: See how 2D areas become 3D volumes through rotation
- **Physics Integration Module**: Connect mathematical integration to real-world physics applications
- **Interactive Controls**: Manipulate functions, adjust parameters, and see real-time results

## Technology Stack

- React for UI components and state management
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- MathJS for mathematical calculations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/VijayaRamesh1/3d-integral-explorer.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd 3d-integral-explorer
